# My Portfolio - Project One

### About

This is my first attempt at creating a fully functional webite. I had a huge break in between studies because we had a baby daughter. When i came back to studying had complelely forgot everything. Had to try and relearn alot of it.
There are still improvements that is want to do. I wanted a full size webite that just had links to my other pages which i was able to achieve.
I will keep improving it as my skills and memory improve.
