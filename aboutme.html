            Hi my name is Kyle Siebert. I am studying to become a full stack
            Developer. I have been in the trade industry for 16 years but have
            always had a love for computers. Being in a trade is very hard on
            the body so made the decision to completly change my path and start
            studying online. I have completed front end introduction and am
            moving on to front end advanced once I finish the assignment. My
            wife (Angela) and I have a 16 month old beautiful girl which is why
            we are planning to move to Austraila to give her a better life. I
            will be looking for a job in the IT industry as soon as I have
            finished my studies.
